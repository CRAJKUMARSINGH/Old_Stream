            as shown in column 4 of Account I, some work has actually been done in connection with several 
            items and the value of such work (after deduction therefrom the proportionate amount of secured 
            advances, if any, ultimately recoverable on account of the quantities of materials used therein) 
            is in no case, less than the advance payments as per item 2 of the Memorandum, if payment is made.
