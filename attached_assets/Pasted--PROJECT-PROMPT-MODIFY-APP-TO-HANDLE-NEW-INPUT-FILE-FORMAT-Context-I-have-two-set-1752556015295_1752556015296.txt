
**PROJECT PROMPT: MODIFY APP TO HANDLE NEW INPUT FILE FORMAT**

**Context:**

* I have two sets of sample test files:

  * **Old Pattern Files** (without title sheet) — previously supported by my app.
  * **New Pattern Files** (contain a title sheet as the first sheet) — need support now.

* My existing application (available at **GitHub1**) processes only the **Old Pattern Files**.

* I want to **update/convert** this application to handle the **New Pattern Files** format directly.

**Requirements:**

1. **File Upload**:

   * The **only user interaction** should be **uploading the file**.
   * No further manual inputs from users should be required.
   * Processing must auto-detect the format (presence of title sheet).

2. **Input File Handling**:

   * **New Pattern Input**:

     * Identify and handle the **title sheet** (present as the first sheet).
     * Skip or parse the title sheet as instructed in the `OVERALL_VIEW.TXT` file.
     * Process subsequent sheets similarly to old files but adapt as needed per the new structure.

3. **Code Conversion**:

   * Update/refactor the app (code at **https://github.com/CRAJKUMARSINGH/Stream-Bill-generator**) to:

     * Replace or modify functions handling file reading/parsing.
     * Remove any input prompts or manual entry dependencies.
     * Ensure fully automated processing once a file is uploaded.

4. **Logic & Process Flow**:

   * Follow all processing and structural guidelines from the **`OVERALL_VIEW.TXT` file**.
   * Ensure all validation, calculations, or data extraction steps work for the new file style.

5. **Delivery Expectations**:

   * Provide the **full refactored code** (ideally in the same programming language as GitHub1).
   * Keep the architecture modular for future updates.
   * Include clear comments explaining the handling of title sheet and any major changes.

**Supporting Files Provided:**

* **Two sets of test files** (Old and New Pattern).
* **`OVERALL_VIEW.TXT`** with detailed processing instructions.
* **GitHub1 Link** to existing tested app code (Old Pattern support).

Let me know if you'd like this rewritten in a more technical or less formal style.
